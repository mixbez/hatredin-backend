Privacy Policy for HatredIn
Last updated: July 10, 2025

HatredIn is a browser extension designed to let users express disapproval of AI-generated or low-effort content on LinkedIn by anonymously incrementing a counter below each post.

What Data We Collect
HatredIn does not collect or store any personal data.

The only information sent to our server is:

A hashed LinkedIn post ID (e.g., urn:li:activity:...)

Whether the user has reported or unreported a specific post

No LinkedIn account information, names, profile URLs, email addresses, or cookies are collected or transmitted.

How We Use the Data
We use the post ID to:

Increment or decrement the visible reaction count

Provide an anonymous tally of how many users have marked a post

This data is not associated with any user or device.

Third-Party Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties. The data is only stored on our backend server hosted by Render.com for the purpose of count tracking.

Analytics
We do not use any analytics, cookies, fingerprinting, or tracking mechanisms.
